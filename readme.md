# Projects to Escape Tutorial Hell

Welcome to **Projects to Escape Tutorial Hell**!  
This repository contains a growing collection of small programming projects, each crafted independently as a way to build confidence, reinforce core concepts, and encourage hands-on learning.

## About

The idea behind this repository is simple:  
Tackle a series of bite-sized projects—ranging from 50 to 100 in total—across different topics and programming languages. Each project is kept small in scope, but is fully implemented and self-contained.

The main goal is to move beyond consuming learning resources and actively apply knowledge to practical problems.  
You'll find implementations in various languages and styles, with a focus on problem-solving, experimentation, and steady improvement.

## Structure

Each numbered folder (`1/`, `2/`, ..., `N/`) contains a single project.  
Within each project folder, you may find code in multiple languages (for example, `.c` and `.js`), as well as compiled binaries for reference.

Examples of projects include:
- Palindrome checker
- Odd/even number detector
- Temperature conversion
- ...and many more as the collection grows!

## How to Use

- Browse the numbered directories to explore individual projects.
- Check out the source code files for each implementation.
- Run or adapt the code for your own practice or experimentation.

## Why This Approach?

Building lots of small, independent projects is a proven way to:
- Solidify understanding of programming fundamentals.
- Get comfortable with multiple languages and tools.
- Foster creativity and confidence by working through obstacles independently.
