The Arch community is a technical community whose shared purpose is to support and enhance Arch Linux.
Arch Linux is a community-driven distribution; the developers, support staff and people who provide assistance in the various fora all do so in their own time, motivated by a shared desire to provide a minimal base system that can be configured by an individual to suit their specific requirements. The code of conduct here has been developed over a number of years and reflects the communityâ€™s ethos of a functional support system with a high signal-to-noise ratio and an explicit expectation of self-sufficiency, willingness to learn and contribution.
Familiarising yourself with the principles and guidelines here is both a courtesy to the community and an effective way of making your initial interactions with other Arch Linux users mutually beneficial.
The rules laid out in this document are necessary limitations to create a community that is useful and welcoming to everybody. They allow members to satisfy all contributive impulses without aggravating themselves or encroaching on the freedom of others. Embracing these principles and obeying the guidelines therefore benefits the entire community by providing freedom from the disorder and other oppressive, harmful and negative consequences of a more chaotic approach.
Common sense introduction
    If you choose to use the Arch Linux distribution, you are welcomed, and encouraged to embrace the Arch Linux principles.
    When asking for help, read the manual, do your research and provide details for those you are asking for assistance.
    When offering help, be as patient and tactful as possible.
Arch is a community of volunteers. Rather than providing a complicated pattern of balanced freedoms and restrictions, as well as the time, resources and personnel required to interpret and administer such rules, we have chosen a simple principle to embrace for the benefit of all. Therefore, this entire document may be condensed into one simple admonition:
Proactively seek to give of yourself and to bring only benefit to your peers and community.
